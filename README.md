Hundreds of millions of people communicate daily their desires, their thoughts and their emotions to intelligent machines like Google, Facebook or Siri. We predict that before the end of this century humans will talk more to machines than to other humans. Emotion synthesis and the use of emotions remain a fundamental need for humans that cannot be addressed by todayâ€™s AI technology.

Imagine intelligent games and Text to Speech engines able to modulate their voice by feeling what they say, avatars with facial expressions and body language directly controlled by the level of their feelings instead of scripts, characters developing their own positive emotional personality learning from gamers interactions. We invite you to take part in the future; in making the world a better place by giving intelligent games sentient building empathy for humans to bring about a positive future.

The growing presence of games and VR in society at large means that meaningful emotional interaction is core to removing the barrier to widespread adoption. Patrick Levy-Rosenthal

This project will allow anyone to create his own Emotion Augmented Reality experience, with emotional awarness in less than 15 minutes.
